# ASleekGeek website repo

AGeekSleek is a blog in one part and a knowledge sharing community in another. There's also a discord server and some info on how you can reach me in case you want to contribute or just have a conversation.

The content of the blog part is static for the most common parts.

    - About - A little bit of history of mine
    - Posts - A collection of links to the blog posts in chronological order
    - Projects - Some projects that I've worked on
        - Github - open source projects list with description
    - Gaming - Gaming section of the website (this was intended to vecome a subset of the blog)
        - There is an integrated Twitch when I stream that shows up here as well
    - Blog posts - depending on relevance and how new they are they might appear further up or down in the blog segment

There are several 'live' pages that are generated from other repos. These are community maintained, so the information is always up to date.

    - free-for-dev - Free resources for developers like free tiers on the cloud providers to tools and services
    - system-design-primer - Resources to help you learn about how to design large-scale systems with examples and real-world architecture examples
