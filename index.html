                        It probably sounds like every other nerd you've met, I know, because it's the typical story of a boy playing video games and learning BASIC on Commodore at 10-11.
                        Yes, I’m one of those, for real and yes, we do exist in real life, we're just no so smart as people think we are, on the contrary...
                        Then around high-school it was C and Assembly. Just before and during university days it was C++. I started doing some professional work during this period,
                        part of the reason why I'm a dropout in my final year.
                        I have never stopped working since then. Going trough a plethora of technologies ranging from C and Assembly languages, Delphi to C++, C#, Java: backend, front-end, even apps and so on and so forth…
                        I'm 40 so you do the math...Here I'll help you a little bit. It's more than 20 ( who counts, does it even matter) years of software development.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        I have never lost love or any of my ambition for the craft from those first young days. This is what I do. I've been happy, I've been hurt, I've done some smart things, I've done stupiud things as well…
                        Since this is more or less the only thing I've always wanted and the only thing I know how to do. I've made it an integral part of my life. That being said I like to get my hands into all aspects of software development.
                        From the tiniest bits to the grandest of architectures of huge complex systems, I've seen a lot but not all...
                        Now a days (read last 5ish years) I've mostly use stuff like C#, .NET / .Net Core, C, Python, JavaScript (some Angular, some React, some ASP.NET).
                        I've built APIs I've worked with data and both SQL and no-sql (Sql-Server, MongoDB, PostgreSql, Cassandra). I've optimized and refactored for performance and for reusabilty. I've containerized with Docker.
                        I've orchestrated with K8s (actually Kubernetes did it for me). I've queued things with MSMQ, RabbitMQ. I've cached distributed and non-distributed.
                        I've used all the possible platforms and hosting ways on prem and cloud: For you buzzword lovers - the focus in most recent projects has been on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), but having been around since there was no cloud I have along the way also
                        crossed paths with AWS, Azure as well. Aaand because a so-called software developer needs to know and do 100 times more tools and technologies than 15 years ago I've fiddled around with various CI/CD stuff:
                        Drone, CircleCI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps and I've grown to like Teraform for wrapping it all up. I've learned that monitoring and logging is what makes you see in the darkness of the complexyty of the systems,
                        where it was love at first sight with DataDog althought I have also used AppDynamics and Kibana. I've learned how to automate the system's watch for security vulnerabilities and I've met the wonderful people from Snyk.

                        In none of these things I'm good at. You can point to me and say he's the greatest living expert on all this stuff. But having the chance to get to know all this and use it has turned me into a more pragmatic person than ever.
                        I've also realized how important open source is and gained great respect for the community. I might be to rusty and too late to the scene,
                        but I'm drawing great deal of inspiration from all this people doing inventive stuff just for the sake of personal satisfaction. I've decided that I want to activelly participate so don't hesitate to reach out for collaboration.

                        I'm also a gamer wannabe (one of those that has a backlog of games that he's never gonna finish) for many years now. I'm not that good at gaming either. But, it's my passion and a hobby and me being a person that I am, I like to give back.
                        So, I became active community represetative trough the XBox Ambassadors programme. I also try to stream on Twitch and have my own Discord. I believe we can all chip in one way or another to make this world fair, inclusive as it once was.
                        In the end, it was what made us become what we are today because if it being the way it is (the gaming community). That's why this website has a whole section dedicated to gaming, so reach out if you're up for collaboration.

                        You can get in touch easily on twitter, or even better, a dedicated discord for this website. In the social media links you can find even more ways to share an opinion, some news, or just let me know how much this whole thing sucks!

                        Happy coding friends!
