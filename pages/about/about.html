<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify has-normal-font-size">It probably sounds like every other nerd cliche, I know, but I have been programming since I was a little boy around 11 years old. Yes, I&#8217;m one of those, for real. First programming language I learned was BASIC, on a Commodore64. Then around high-school it was C and Assembly. Just before and during university days it was C++. I started doing some professional work during this period, part of the reason why I left in my final year. I have never stopped since then. Going trough a plethora of technologies ranging from C and Assembly languages, Delphi to C++, C#, Java and so on and so forth&#8230; trough 20 (and more, who counts, does it even matter) years of software development. </p>
