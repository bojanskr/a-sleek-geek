<p>From the many activities and awesome stuff we've got going on at <a href="http://tretton37.com/">tretton37</a>, one is virtual reality. We are a bunch of guys&nbsp;particularly interested in this subject and willing to experiment with various equipment and software around it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The spotlight of the industry on VR has come back in the recent years as these gadgets gain more and more popularity in the community&nbsp;(especially emphasized&nbsp;since Facebook acquired these guys last year). I have always, since I was a little kid fascinated by the opportunities that they&nbsp;provide.</p>

<p>Now one of those nice gadgets has arrived. Actually, it has been there for a while now, but I've been too preoccupied to pick it up at home and play around with it. But now I finally got it. The <a href="https://www.oculus.com/dk2/">Oculus Development Kit (DK2)</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While we are at this subject, I just want to mention that there is&nbsp;some other VR hardware available, such as:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/gearvr/">Samsung Gear VR</a>, <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/steamvr">Steam VR</a>, <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/introducing-the-leap-motion-plugin-for-ue4">Leap Motion</a>, and <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/tag/project-morpheus/">Sony Project Morpheus</a>. But, we got this one, as everyone in our group believed that it is the most suitable for us to try.</p>

<p>So, aside from the initial "wow", it looks nice effect, I had to try it out. I have had tried it out before in our office, but it already had been set up and I just turned it on and hit a bunch of buttons to enjoy the view. This was different. I actually would need to set up everything from scratch.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The guys from Oculus did a pretty good job at documenting everything so if you go to their website there are documents with instructions you can download to get things going.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The very first thing you need to do is to install the runtime. At the time of writing this the latest version was&nbsp;0.6.0.0-beta. But that didn't work with my device(I have no idea why. In their support pages I found an answer saying that this is happening on processors that do&nbsp;not support SSE 4.1, which is basically pre-2010 even though I have a MacBook Pro with Windows, from last year).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With little fiddling around and getting frustrated from the message "Service&nbsp;has crashed", I downloaded the previous version of the runtime and installed that one. This time it worked. After the installation of the drivers(which on my computer installed automatically when I inserted the usbs) and the runtime, a tool appears in the system tray called&nbsp; “Oculus Configuration Utility” (OculusConfigUtil) where you can set it up. With the 0.6 version it kept disconnecting when I was trying to run the "Show Demo Scene". But, with version&nbsp;0.5.0.1-beta, it worked like a charm (just remember: you must uninstall everything prior to installing a new version, so if you plan to fiddle around with different versions like I did have this in mind).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, next to try was the SDK. You have to download the matching SDK for the runtime version that you have installed, of course. So, I did that, and first thing I went straight to the "World Demo", ran it, and ka-boom there it was, right in front of me :) my new friend Oculus in full effect.</p>

<p>Well, You can move forward and all directions and for a demo it is fantastic, but I had to know more. There is an introduction&nbsp;application that you can download that is has a pretty good intro to what the Oculus can do. You can find it here:&nbsp;<a href="http://share.oculus.com/app/welcome-to-oculus">http://share.oculus.com/app/welcome-to-oculus</a>, and while you're there you can download lots of other apps and enjoy trying it out. There's all sorts of stuff people make, and some of them are really fun.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Next up on my challenge was to determine how I can make my own stuff for it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After doing (not so) thorough analysis, for me personal it came down to two platforms: <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity </a>and <a href="http://www.unrealengine.com">Unreal Engine</a>. They both have their strong and weaker areas, and different pricing strategies. But for a personal beginner like me the price doesn't make the difference as I will not get rich from it. Unity has a really good scripting platform and you can script in C#, which is a huge&nbsp;advantage for .NET developers. But I chose Unreal Engine to start with as it is being said that it has better graphics than Unity. It is C++ &nbsp;based, but that is not a deal breaker for me, since I was a C/C++ developer in the past, and I hope I still remember many things. For now I just enjoy myself with what the others have done and started doing some really basic stuff in Unreal Engine.</p>

<p>Who knows maybe, just maybe me and VR hit it off into something more serious&nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Until next time...Happy coding my friends.</p>
