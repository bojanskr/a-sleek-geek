            <p class="has-text-align-justify" style="font-size:18px;">gRPC is a modern open source high performance
                Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect
                services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking
                and authentication. It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices,
                mobile applications and browsers to backend services.</p>

    <h3 class="alignwide" id="the-story-behind-grpc">The story behind gRPC<a
            href="https://grpc.io/about/#the-story-behind-grpc"></a></h3>



    <p>gRPC was initially created by Google, which has used a single general-purpose RPC infrastructure
        called&nbsp;<strong>Stubby</strong>&nbsp;to connect the large number of microservices running within and across
        its data centers for over a decade. In March 2015, Google decided to build the next version of Stubby and make
        it open source. The result was gRPC, which is now used in many organizations outside of Google to power use
        cases from microservices to the “last mile” of computing (mobile, web, and Internet of Things).</p>



    <h3 class="alignwide">Short Overview</h3>



    <p class="has-text-align-justify">In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server application
        on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications
        and services. As in many RPC systems, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the
        methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. On the server side, the server
        implements this interface and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls. On the client side, the client has a
        stub (referred to as just a client in some languages) that provides the same methods as the server.</p>



    <p style="line-height:1;">An interesting part:</p>

    <h4><strong><a href="https://www.grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/#overview">Official gRPC website overview</a></strong></h4>



    <p class="has-normal-font-size">gRPC clients and servers can run and talk to each other in a variety of environments
        &#8211; from servers inside Google to your own desktop &#8211; and can be written in any of <kbd>gRPC’s
        </kbd>supported languages. So, for example, you can easily create a <kbd>gRPC </kbd>server in Java with clients
        in Go, Python, or Ruby. In addition, the latest Google APIs will have <kbd>gRPC </kbd>versions of their
        interfaces, letting you easily build Google functionality into your applications.</p>

    <h3 class="alignwide">Protocol Buffers</h3>



    <p>gRPC utilizes <strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">PROTOCOL BUFFERS</a></strong>
        &#8211; Google&#8217;s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data
        – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.</p>



    <p>A good place to start is Google&#8217;s official documentation at:</p>

    <h3 class="alignwide">GitHub Repositories</h3>



    <p>So much for the introduction. Now let&#8217;s go to GitHub and see something more practical.</p>



    <p>First let&#8217;s list the repos that are important for us here:</p>



    <div>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc">https://github.com/grpc/grpc </a>
                <ul>
                    <li>this is the main repo from where you can start, it contains tons of useful info like links to
                        docs, chats, information on how to start using gRPC etc</li>
                    <li>this repository contains source code for gRPC libraries implemented in multiple languages
                        written on top of a shared C core library&nbsp;<a
                            href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/core">src/core</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>the frpc.io website repo, there&#8217;s also instructions on how to get the docs for the
                        submodules here as well</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>



    <p>Now the repos for the different implementations / different technologies:</p>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>



        <ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>gRPC C#</li>
                    <li>there is also a new implementation for .net core 3.0 and above and that repo is at: <a
                            href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet">https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet</a></li>
                    <li>You can read more on <a
                            href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/?view=aspnetcore-5.0">Introduction
                            to gRPC on .NET</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>



        <ul>
            <li><a
                    href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/python/grpcio">https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/python/grpcio</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>for Python installation: <code>pip install grpcio</code></li>
                    <li>note: Python version 3.5 and greater are supported</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>






    <p>Well that was a very short intro for now. I really can&#8217;t wait to start digging a little bit deeper into
        this promising tech. Until then&#8230;</p>



    <p>Happy coding friends!</p>
